/**
 * An implementation of a spring system layout strategy with gravity towards the center.
 * <br/>
 * Applies the same spring system as {@link ForceDirectedSpringSystemLayoutStrategy} but with added gravitational pull
 * towards the center of the panel. Even with bipartite graphs, they will not repel each other to the edges of the panel.
 * <br/>
 * Parameters:
 * <br/>
 * Repulsive force (> 0): Recommended [1, 50]. Default 25. The strength of the repulsive force between nodes.
 * Higher values result in greater repulsion.
 * <br/>
 * Attraction force (> 0): Recommended [1, 5]. Default 3. The strength of the attractive force between connected nodes.
 * Higher values result in stronger attraction. Careful, because larger values may not produce stable states.
 * <br/>
 * Attraction scale (> 0): Recommended [1, ?]. Default 10. The scale factor for attraction.
 * It determines the effectiveness of the attraction force based on the distance between connected nodes.
 * <br/>
 * Acceleration: Mandatory ]0, 1]. Default 0.8. The acceleration factor applied to node movements.
 * Higher values result in faster movements.
 * <br/>
 * Gravity (> 0): Recommended ]0, 0.1]. Default 0.01. The higher the value, the more dominant the gravitation "pull" is.
 * Careful, because larger values may not produce stable states. The gravity force is applied after
 * the attraction/repulsive forces between nodes are computed. We don't want this force to dominate the layout placement.
 *
 * @param <V> The generic type of {@link SmartGraphVertexNode}, i.e., the nodes of a {@link SmartGraphPanel}.
